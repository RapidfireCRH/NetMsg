NetMsg - A simple udp chat client.

Put the ip you want to send to, and send udp messages.

Will also receive any messages on port and relay them to the client

Limitations:

Cannot send pictures or anything else but text

Cautions:

There is no sanitation of received messages meaning remote code execution could be an issue.
